Website development for the Pyra

The website of the upcoming DragonBox Pyra handheld is being created openly by community members using that git.  
It is cloned every 5 minutes into http://webdev.pyra-handheld.com/ for public live testing on the server.


The following members have full access to the GIT:

If you want to help as well, contact EvilDragon at the forums (http://boards.openpandora.org/) or via eMail (EvilDragon@openpandora.org).  
You can also guest-commit, but that needs to be approved by a team member.
